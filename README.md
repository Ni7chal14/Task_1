Elevate Labs Internship Task-1 23rd June 2025

In this project, I worked on preprocessing the Titanic dataset. I started by exploring the data, identifying missing values, and dropping the ‘Cabin’ column due to too many nulls. I filled missing values in the ‘Age’ column using the median and in ‘Embarked’ using the mode. Then, I converted categorical features like ‘Sex’ and ‘Embarked’ into numerical form using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding. I also standardized numerical columns like ‘Age’ and ‘Fare’ to bring them onto a similar scale. Finally, I visualized and removed outliers using boxplots and the IQR method to clean the data for better model performance.
